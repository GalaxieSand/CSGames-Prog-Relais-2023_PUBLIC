## Context

The universities commite has many projects that must be put in place in order to sustain our new cities and society. In order to not be reliant on any single individual, to share knowledge and promote collaboration, the commite has decided that every project must be worked on and shared by multiple programmers. Three inital projects have been selected to be completed by your team. You must use good coding principales to facilitate comprehension of your code as you will switch projects with your team members after each hour.
