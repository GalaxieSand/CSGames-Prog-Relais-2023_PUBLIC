# Translation Service Challenge - CSGames 2023

## Context

With people arriving to the new underwater cities en mass and the critical need for cooperation, the universities commitee needs a way to allow people to easily communicate between different languages. 

## General overview

Your team has been mandated by the commitee to create a translation program that will allow users to choose a source language, input text and then translate it to a target language. This will require the creation of a user friendly GUI and obviously the code to handle the translation.

## Comptetition value

`400 points`

## Tasks

This program must be written in **Python**

### GUI

For the GUI portion of this project, **you must use the Tkinter library** : [tkinter](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html)
